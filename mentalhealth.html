<h1 class="txt"> 1. Seasonal Depression (Seasonal Affective Disorder) </h1>
<img src="seasonal-depression.jpg"  width=1200 height=600>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Do the winter months get you down more than you think they should? If so, you might have seasonal depression, also known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD).

Seasonal depression is a mood disorder that happens every year at the same time. A rare form of seasonal depression, known as "summer depression," begins in late spring or early summer and ends in fall. In general, though, seasonal affective disorder starts in fall or winter and ends in spring or early summer.
Causes

While we don't know the exact causes of SAD, some scientists think that certain hormones made deep in the brain trigger attitude-related changes at certain times of year. Experts believe that SAD may be related to these hormonal changes. One theory is that less sunlight during fall and winter leads to the brain making less serotonin, a chemical linked to brain pathways that regulate mood. When nerve cell pathways in the brain that regulate mood don't function normally, the result can be feelings of depression, along with symptoms of fatigue and weight gain.

SAD usually starts in young adulthood and is more common in women than men. Some people with SAD have mild symptoms and feel out of sorts or irritable. Others have worse symptoms that interfere with relationships and work.

Because the lack of enough daylight during wintertime is related to SAD, it's less often found in countries where there's plenty of sunshine year-round.
Winter Symptoms

People with SAD have many of the normal warning signs of depression, including:

    Less energy
    Trouble concentrating
    Fatigue
    Greater appetite
    Increased desire to be alone
    Greater need for sleep
    Weight gain

Summer Symptoms

    Less appetite
    Trouble sleeping
    Weight loss

Diagnosis

If you've been feeling depressed and have some of the above symptoms, see your doctor for an assessment. They will recommend the right form of treatment for you.
Treatment

There are different treatments, depending on the severity of your symptoms. Also, if you have another type of depression or bipolar disorder, the treatment may be different.

Traditional antidepressants are often used to treat seasonal depression.  Bupropion XL is currently the only medication that is FDA-approved specifically to prevent major depressive episodes in people with SAD.

Many doctors recommend that people with SAD get outside early in the morning to get more natural light. If this is impossible because of the dark winter months, antidepressant medications or light therapy (phototherapy) may help.

<h1 class="txt"> 2. Psychotic Depression </h1>

<img src="psychotic depression2.jpg" width=1200 height=600>
<p style="font-weight: bold">Psychotic depression is a subtype of major depression that occurs when a severe depressive illness includes some form of psychosis. The psychosis could be hallucinations (such as hearing a voice telling you that you are no good or worthless), delusions (such as, intense feelings of worthlessness, failure, or having committed a sin) or some other break with reality. Psychotic depression affects roughly one out of every four people admitted to the hospital for depression.
How Is Psychotic Depression Different From Major or Clinical Nonpsychotic Depression?

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, a person who is psychotic is out of touch with reality. People with psychosis may hear "voices." Or they may have strange and illogical ideas. For example, they may think that others can hear their thoughts or are trying to harm them. Or they might think they are possessed by the devil or are wanted by the police for having committed a crime that they really did not commit.

People with psychotic depression may get angry for no apparent reason. Or they may spend a lot of time by themselves or in bed, sleeping during the day and staying awake at night. A person with psychotic depression may neglect appearance by not bathing or changing clothes. Or that person may be hard to talk to. Perhaps they barely talk or else says things that make no sense.

People with other mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, also experience psychosis. But those with psychotic depression usually have delusions or hallucinations that are consistent with themes about depression (such as worthlessness or failure), whereas psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia are more often bizarre or implausible and have no obvious connection to a mood state (for example, thinking strangers are following them for no reason other than to harass them). People with psychotic depression also may be humiliated or ashamed of the thoughts and try to hide them. Doing so makes this type of depression very difficult to diagnose.

But diagnosis is important. Its treatment is different than for nonpsychotic depression. Also, having one episode of psychotic depression increases the chance of bipolar disorder with recurring episodes of psychotic depression, mania, and even suicide.</p>


<h1 class="txt"> 3. Treatment-Resistant Depression </h1>

<img src="treatment-resistant depression.png" width=1200 height=600> 
<p style="font-weight: bold">How well is your depression treatment working? Does it help a bit, but you still don't feel as if the darkness has lifted? Perhaps you feel the treatment isn't working at all. If so, you could have treatment-resistant depression, also called refractory depression.

Unfortunately, depression treatments don't always work. As many as two-thirds of people with depression aren't helped by the first antidepressant they try. Up to a third don't respond to several attempts at treatment.

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) can leave you feeling hopeless and discouraged. Months or even years can go by without any relief. And after the effort it took to get help, it can be demoralizing when you're just not getting better.

But if your depression treatment isn't working, don't give up. Many people can get their treatment-resistant depression under control. You and your doctor just need to find the right approach. This might include different drugs, therapy, and other treatments. If you're still struggling with depression despite treatment, here's what you need to know.
Understanding Treatment-Resistant Depression

What is treatment-resistant depression? Surprisingly, that can be hard to answer. Experts still disagree on what exactly the term means.

Some researchers define TRD as a case of depression that doesn't respond to two different antidepressants from different classes. Other experts say that a person needs to try at least four different treatments before depression can be truly considered treatment-resistant.

Of course for you, the exact definition doesn't matter. You just need to ask yourself some basic questions.

    Has your treatment failed to make you feel better?
    Has your treatment helped a bit, but you still don’t feel like your old self?
    Have the side effects of your medication been hard to handle?

If the answer is yes to any of these, you need to see your doctor. Whether or not you actually have treatment-resistant depression, you need expert help.
Treatment-Resistant Depression: Getting Help

Although a primary care doctor can treat depression (research suggests that 60%-65% of antidepressants are prescribed by primary care physicians), it may be best to see a specialist, like a psychiatrist, if you think you may have treatment-resistant depression. It's a good idea to also work with a therapist, like a psychologist or social worker, because the best treatment is often a combination of medicine and therapy.</p>

<h1 class="txt"> 4. Depression Complications </h1>
<img src="depressioncomplications.jpg" width=800 height=500>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Are you worried about depression complications? Even for people who suffer with milder forms of depression, this mood disorder can affect many facets of their life. Clinical depression can complicate serious health conditions such as heart disease or cancer. Depression can lead to problems with pain, sexual desire and performance, and sleep. The more you know about depression complications, the more you'll u nderstand why it's important to not let clinical depression go untreated.
What is depression?

Depression is a condition that generally is associated with being "stuck" in a mood of sadness or grief accompanied by a number of physical symptoms. Everyone gets sad from time to time. But clinical depression, which comes in many different forms, is typically characterized by a longer-than-normal duration of this sad or morose mood.
What are symptoms of depression?

Symptoms of depression can vary with the type of depression a person has. While there are several types of depression, these are some of the more common symptoms:

    Persistently sad mood, "feeling blue"
    Feelings of hopelessness and a pessimistic outlook on life
    Guilty feelings, feelings of worthlessness
    Loss of libido
    Insomnia, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping
    Decreased appetite and/or weight loss or overeating and weight gain
    Loss of interest in hobbies and other social activities
    Fatigue, decreased energy
    Thoughts of suicide or suicide attempts
    Restlessness, irritability
    Difficulty concentrating, remembering, making decisions
    Persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive disorders, and chronic pains

Why is depression common in people with chronic illness?

People with chronic medical illnesses have difficulty adjusting to the demands of the illness. At the same time, they need to focus on the treatments for their medical condition. But the chronic illness may affect a person's mobility and independence. And it can change the way a person see them or themselves as well as the way the person relates to the outside world. So it's not surprising that studies indicate that as many as one out of every three people with a serious medical condition reports experiencing depression.

Clinical depression is one of the most common complications associated with chronic medical illnesses. In some cases, a chronic illness may actually trigger depression.</p>


<h1 class="txt"> 5. Bipolar Disorder </h1>
<img src="bipolar-disorder.png" width=1200 height=600>
<p style="font-weight: bold">Sometimes called manic depression, bipolar disorder causes extreme shifts in mood. People who have it may spend weeks feeling like they're on top of the world before plunging into a deep depression. The length of each high and low varies greatly from person to person.</p>

<h2>What the Depression Phase Is Like:</h2>


<p>Without treatment, a person with bipolar disorder may have intense episodes of depression. Symptoms include sadness, anxiety, loss of energy, hopelessness, and trouble concentrating. They may lose interest in activities that they used to enjoy. It’s also common to gain or lose weight, sleep too much or too little, and even think about suicide.</p>

<h2>When Someone Is Manic:</h2>

<p>During this phase, people feel super-charged and think they can do anything. Their self-esteem soars out of control and it’s hard for them to sit still. They talk more, are easily distracted, their thoughts race, and they don’t sleep enough. It often leads to reckless behavior, such as spending sprees, cheating, fast driving, and substance abuse. Three or more of these symptoms nearly every day for a week accompanied by feelings of intense excitement may signal a manic episode.
</p>

<h2>Bipolar I vs. Bipolar II:</h2>

<p>People with bipolar I disorder have manic phases for at least a week. Many also have separate depression phases, too.

Those with bipolar ll have bouts of major depression, but instead of full manic episodes, they have low-grade hypomanic swings that are less intense and may  last less than a week. They may seem fine, even like the “life of the party,” though family and friends notice their mood changes.</p>
<h2>What Are the Causes?</h2>

<p>
Doctors don’t know exactly what causes bipolar disorder. Current theories hold that the disorder may result from a combination of genetic and other biological -- as well as environmental -- factors. Scientists think that brain circuits involved in the regulation of mood, energy, thinking, and biological rhythms may function abnormally in people with bipolar disorder resulting in the mood and other changes associated with the illness.</p>
